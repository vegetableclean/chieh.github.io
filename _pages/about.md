Hey, thanks for stopping by! :sparkles: :smile:

I’m a PhD student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at the [University of Arizona](https://ece.engineering.arizona.edu/), advised by Prof. [Salim Hariri](https://ece.engineering.arizona.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/salim-hariri/) in the [Autonomic Computing Laboratory](https://nsfcac.org/).

I work at the intersection of AI, cybersecurity, and autonomous vehicles, focusing on resilience—anticipating, withstanding, and recovering from failures and attacks. I design and evaluate ML-driven defenses to make autonomy safer, including experiments on a [Quanser Qcar2 testbed](https://www.quanser.com/products/qcar-2/)

Previously, I worked on satellite image super-resolution with deep learning and co-authored work on nation-scale image analysis in [VIP lab](https://sites.google.com/view/viplabntust/) as a research assistant. I received my M.S. in Electronics and Computer Engineering from the [National Taiwan University of Science and Technology](https://ece.ntust.edu.tw/index.php?Lang=en), where my thesis explored age and gender classification with cGAN augmentation.

Outside the lab, I enjoy music— I play the violin, piano, and ukulele, and I won a singing competition in high school.
